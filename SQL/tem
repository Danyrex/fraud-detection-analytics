# Table Creation with appropriate datatypes (VARCHAR for trans_num, FLOAT for lat/long, INT for age, etc.).

# Feature Engineering in SQL:

age: computed from dob and transaction date.

hour_of_day: extracted from transaction timestamp.

day_of_week: derived from transaction timestamp.

time_category: grouped into Morning, Afternoon, Night.

**Views (vw_FraudData)** were created with only business-relevant columns.



# Why Views?

Hide sensitive data (cc_num, trans_num).

Improve Power BI performance (lighter dataset).

Keep dashboards focused on business KPIs.
